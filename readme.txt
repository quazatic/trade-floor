Overview

This project is a React + FastAPI trading app designed for stock market research, backtesting, and strategy validation. It integrates real-time & historical stock data, options trading analysis, and AI-powered predictions to give traders a powerful tool for market analysis.

Features

✅ Frontend (React + Vite + TailwindCSS)

Live Market Dashboard (Track real-time stock/option prices)

Earnings Scanner (Identify high-probability trades based on volatility & options flow)

Backtesting Engine (Run Monte Carlo simulations, permutation tests, and validate trading strategies)

Trade Execution & Simulation (Paper trading, Kelly Criterion position sizing)

✅ Backend (FastAPI + Python)

Stock & Options Data Fetching (Yahoo Finance, Polygon.io, Alpaca API integration)

Backtesting & Monte Carlo Simulations (Validate strategies before live trading)

AI/ML Predictions (LSTMs, sentiment analysis, and options flow tracking)

Database for Trade Logging (Track trades, PnL, risk metrics, and user performance)
